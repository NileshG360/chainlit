   step 1: Keep an open line of communication. This means talk to your childâ€”and listen. Make it clear to your child that drug and alcohol use is not allowed!
   step 2: Know the whereabouts of your teen. Make sure you always know where your teen is and what he/she is doing. If the information is not volunteered, ASK! Children and teens who do not have adult supervision are far more likely to be involved in drugs, alcohol, and other risky behavior.
   step 3: Get to know your teen's friends, and help your teen learn to choose friends wisely. Almost always, kids are introduced to drugs and alcohol use through their friends.
